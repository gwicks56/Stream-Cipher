Please Note:

This program worked perfectly on my home PC with the examples provided.
I cannot test on the server, i can get an error message:

SERVER_DHEX_ERROR: Client provided shared key is different to Server shared key

I can't work out why this is, my DHEX module worked perfectly in PART A, and I have just
copied and pasted it into this implementation.
